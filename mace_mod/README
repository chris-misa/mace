Egress correlation problem using per-cpu solution

Ingress is trickier:

Perhaps we can learn from mace-ping: trace-probes can infact get at the content of the packet:

  From looking at do_syscall_64() regs should remain unchanged through to trace_sys_exit so let's use them!

  
regs <-> arg mapping (assuming x86_64, i.e. #define CONFIG_X86_64)
          . . . also recorded the fields for sendto syscall

di  : 0 (socket) int
si  : 1 (message) char * (in userspace?)
dx  : 2 (message len) size_t
r10 : 3 (flags) int
r8  : 4 (dest_addr) struct sockaddr *
r9  : 5 (dest_len) socklen_t

  For recvmsg `si` should be pointer to struct msghdr.

  Then do some checksum on packet's data buffer which should be
accessible through skb in net:* and through message char * from above. . .
