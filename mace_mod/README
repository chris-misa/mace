Egress correlation problem using per-cpu solution

From looking at do_syscall_64() regs should remain unchanged through to trace_sys_exit so let's use them!

  
regs <-> arg mapping (assuming x86_64, i.e. #define CONFIG_X86_64)
          . . . also recorded the fields for sendto syscall

di  : 0 (socket) int
si  : 1 (message) char * (in userspace?)
dx  : 2 (message len) size_t
r10 : 3 (flags) int
r8  : 4 (dest_addr) struct sockaddr *
r9  : 5 (dest_len) socklen_t

  For recvmsg `si` should be pointer to struct msghdr.


Ingress (for now):
  Calculate key based on packet's payload. Have to skip IP header because this
will change during NAT.


Go for the first 8 bytes after the ip header. This should capture
sufficient identifying information for packets in a number of common formats:

  ICMP: Type, code, checksum, id, sequence (entire ICMP header)
  UDP: source port, dest port, length, checksum (entire UDP header)
  TCP: source port, dest port, sequence number
