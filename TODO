Synchronization Issues:

  between intra-kernal tracking and userspace ring buffer.

    Maybe use 'writing' bit to keep readers off of currently writing entries?
    Allow for pipe-style reading rather than buffer dumping style.


Separation of to userspace ring buffer by namespace (to allow for independent clearing).
Maybe a case for using struct idr?

Add latencies pipe (blocking reads) file to sysfs.
