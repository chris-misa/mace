Synchronization Issues:

  between intra-kernal tracking and userspace ring buffer.

    Maybe use 'writing' bit to keep readers off of currently writing entries?

Separation of to userspace ring buffer by namespace (mainly to allow for independent clearing).
Maybe a case for using struct idr?

Add latencies pipe (blocking reads) file to sysfs.

Develop stress tests. . .
